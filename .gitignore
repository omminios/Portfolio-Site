# IMPORTANT: WordPress Configuration File
# NEVER commit your live wp-config.php file.
# Create it on the server or use environment variables.
# If you have a wp-config-local.php for local dev, that's fine to ignore too.

# Specific plugin or theme caches/data you don't want to track
# /wp-content/plugins/some-plugin/cache/
# /wp-content/themes/your-theme/cache/

# WordPress Must-Use Plugins (mu-plugins)
# Usually, you want to commit these as they are critical.
# If you have specific mu-plugins you generate or don't want to track, list them:
# /wp-content/mu-plugins/generated-plugin.php

# WordPress Plugins
# OPTION 1: If you manage plugins with Composer (recommended), ignore the whole directory.
# Your composer.json and composer.lock will define your plugins.
# /wp-content/plugins/
# OPTION 2: If you commit all plugins (e.g., free ones from .org and premium/custom).
# In this case, DON'T ignore /wp-content/plugins/.
# You might still want to ignore specific plugins if they are very large or have their own repos:
# /wp-content/plugins/some-large-plugin/
# /wp-content/plugins/plugin-with-its-own-repo/

# WordPress Themes
# You will almost certainly want to commit your active theme(s).
# Ignore default WordPress themes if you don't use or customize them.
/wp-content/themes/twenty*/
# Ignore other themes you don't use.
# /wp-content/themes/some-other-theme/
# If you use a parent theme and a child theme, commit both.
